# Hashing-Functions-Swift-Playgrounds

Different people have different definitions for functions, for instance, computer scientists and programmers might call it a data structure mechanism that takes and input and performs operations, and (sometimes) returns a result. 

Mathematicians might call functions as a way to model behavior of an input parameter. (Calculus to Topology). Physicists use functions to emulate the changing states of real world objects.

**In essence all these are are talking about the same thing.** Functions are quintessentially, structures that take in an Input and return an output based on given operands.


This Swift Playground is about teaching Hashing Functions to students. I take through Hash Functions from 2 vantage points. They are File Comparisons and Hashed Lookups. These are the 2 ways that Hashing Functions are used.
